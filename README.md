This software is designed to allow users to easily and intuitively create fan-made Pokemon (usually dubbed Fakemon). It is intended to be used by Pokemon fans who wish to create Fakemon of their own. Additionally, users can create their own abilities or moves which will be stored within the program. Through the use of JavaFX, it provides an intuitive GUI with buttons for the user to add, remove, edit, or view abilities, moves, and Fakemon. While the creation of Fakemon is possible with a sheet of paper or a text document, my hope is that this program will provide a more streamlined process. Specifically, I hope to store all of the necessary information in one place to remove the hassle of constantly googling abilities or moves and allow for easy Fakemon creation without an internet connection.
